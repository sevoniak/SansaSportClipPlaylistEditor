# SansaSportClipPlaylistEditor
A simple playlist editor for the Sansa Sport Clip mp3 player

## Description
This is a simple playlist editor that I wrote for my mp3 player as a coding exercise. The user can create new playlists (in .m3u form), add, remove , and reorder songs on those lists. Two lists can be combined into a single list by adding the second list to the first with the "add tracks" button.
This project was written using Visual Studio 2012 for the Window platform.

## Dependencies
The library "comctl32.lib" must be linked in order for this to compile.
